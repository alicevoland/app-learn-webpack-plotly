# App Learn Webpack Plotly

This app is a toy project meant to help me learn webpack with rails and using a js plotting lib (plotly.js).

## On heroku

[app-learn-webpack-plotly.herokuapp.com](https://app-learn-webpack-plotly.herokuapp.com/) (synced with `master` branch)

## Locally

`bundle install` and use as a rails app (consider using also `./bin/webpack-dev-server` as the app uses webpack)
